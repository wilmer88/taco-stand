### quiero tacos


food service worker.The aplication helps customers and buisness owner save time
by allowing the customer to order tacos ahead of leaving their current location and also helps the seller by not slowing down or stoping their current order.  All the app does the math recive the order to be prepared asap and the aplication does all the work with the math/chargest and informing both parties of the order cost/bill . No more missed or miss understood when talking over the phone or screaming thru foodtruck windows; just a smooth ride for both sides.

quiero tacos was buildt as a passion project with the idea of solving, helping and enjoying the food truck industry, home cooks, and food service worker.
### technoligies, functuality , fetures
The front end is built with an App.js file that uses react-router-dom for state,props, Routes, Server Rendering and other Metheds. I built the appclication having in mind current best practices from React, bulma frame work, custom CSS,  Javascript functuality and libarys with a spriknle of jquery to help out on one or two things that were holding back production. I designed the aplication to be mobile responsive for all mobile devises. 
bcrypt,The Aplication is Currently in production and hosted by Github and Heroku; Heroku enables the applicaction to store data from the backend. The backend is incorpriated with Node.JS, many NPM packages like Morgan for logging errors; nth-check for parseing and compiling; axios for making API calls; svgo for optimizing files and many more node packages. I chose MongoDB as my application data platform/database; The data is modeled using Mongoose. Middleware is used along with express- working as my server sofware for comunicating with the front end, the controller/routes/mini app, that allows me to communicate the database. I also incoperated json web tokens, the use of headers, bcrypt and envierment variables for hashing passwords and adding a bit of cyber security. Inserted Athorization, Authentication as protection to some application access.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
